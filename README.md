This is a pure-Elixir forward-chaining rule engine based on the classic [Rete algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm).

It's a port of the [Ruby library](https://github.com/ulfurinn/wongi-engine) of the same name. It aims to keep the public API close enough for rules to be easily portable, where their respective languages align.

## Acknowledgements

The Rete implementation in this library largely follows the outline presented in [\[Doorenbos, 1995\]](http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/1995/CMU-CS-95-113.pdf), although by now it is three rewrites away from the original pseudocode.
